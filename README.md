## DISCLAIMER
I don't test ALL .ovpn files, i just download and put them here, some servers may not work

> ### How do they work?
.ovpn files can be opened with [OpenVPN Connect](https://openvpn.net/download-open-vpn/), some require username and password, some don't.
Usernames and passwords can be found inside the Password.url in the vpn folder (passwords are randomly generated, they're not static so don't save them)

> ### What do "FOV", "FN4Y", "VBK" and "IPS" mean?
[Free OpenVPN](https://www.freeopenvpn.org/), [Free VPN 4 You](https://freevpn4you.net/), [VPN Book](https://www.vpnbook.com/) and [IPSpeed](https://ipspeed.info/), which are the sites i downloaded .ovpn files from
